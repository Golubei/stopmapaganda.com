🔹 Idea

Stop Mapaganda! is a civic initiative aimed at countering cartographic disinformation and the distortion of Ukraine’s territorial integrity in global media, mapping services, and educational resources.
The project emerged in 2022 as a response to the wave of propaganda following Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Its mission is to promote “information de-occupation” — to remind the world that maps are not neutral images but powerful political tools that shape perception and narratives.

🔹 Goals

Detect and expose manipulations or inaccuracies in how Ukraine’s borders are displayed in digital maps and media.
Strengthen public media literacy through interactive content, visual storytelling, and analytical articles.
Motivate international companies and publishers to correct misleading cartographic data.
Unite IT professionals, designers, journalists, and human-rights advocates around the ethics of cartography and truthful representation of Ukraine.

🔹 Role and Implementation

I, Mykola Golubei, acted as the founder and project manager of the initiative and led the development of its official website.
My responsibilities included:
Concept development and visual identity design;
Managing a volunteer team of developers and designers;
Designing the information architecture and bilingual content system (English / Ukrainian);
Implementing the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
Coordinating communication with media partners, NGOs, and public institutions.
The website is a static web platform hosted on GitHub Pages, serving as an open-source example of civic digital advocacy.

🔹 Recognition and Media Coverage

The Stop Mapaganda project has been featured in international and Ukrainian media, drawing attention to the topic of informational warfare and the responsibility of digital platforms in representing Ukraine fairly.
The initiative has received official acknowledgements and letters of thanks from prominent institutions, including:
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine;
The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security under the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine;
The Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States;
As well as numerous international partners, media organizations, and IT companies.
